    "### 1. Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### According to the reading, the output of a data mining exercise largely depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The quality of the data.\n",
    "* The data scientist.\n",
    "* The scope of the project.\n",
    "* The programming language used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans: The quality of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### When data are missing in a systematic way, you can simply extrapolate the data or impute the missing data by filling in the average of the values around the missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* False.\n",
    "* True.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans: True\n",

    "### Ans: Principal Component Analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "### After the data are appropriately processed, transformed, and stored, machine learning and non-parametric methods are a good starting point for data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "* True.\n",
    "* False.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans: True\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "### In-sample forecast is the process of formally evaluating the predictive capabilities of the models developed using observed data to see how effective the algorithms are in reproducing data.\n",
