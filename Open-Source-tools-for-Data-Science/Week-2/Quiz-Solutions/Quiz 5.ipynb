    "## 1.Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the key difference between Skills Network Labs and IBM Watson Studio (Data Science Experience)?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A. IBM Watson Studio is an enterprise-ready environment with scalability in mind, whereas Skills Network Labs is primarily a learning environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B. IBM Watson Studio has a concept of \"Projects\" for Jupyter Notebooks, whereas Skills Netowrk Labs does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C. There is no difference between IBM Watson Studio and Skills Network Labs\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans: A\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2.Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "### True or False? The only way to add notebooks to your project on IBM Watson Studio is to either create an empty notebook, or upload a notebook from your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "False\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans: True\n",

    "## 3.Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "### Which of the follow options are correct? Select all that apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A. You can add collaborators to projects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Collaborators on a project can add comments to notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C. Projects are public and anyone can access the notebooks or data within.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "D. You can use Python 3, R or Scala with Jupyter Notebooks on Watson Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans: A, B, D\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "### In the upper right-hand corner of a Jupyter Notebook is the kernel interpreter (e.g., Python 3). Next to it is a circle. What does it mean if the circle is a full, black circle and what should you do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A. A black circle means that the kernel is not ready to execute more code. You can either wait, interrupt, or try to restart the kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "B. A black circle means that the kernel is ready to execute code. You can run code as normal, which will be executed by the kernel as it is ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "C. A black circle means that the notebook is currently being saved, and you can wait a few seconds for it to finish saving.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "D. A black circle means that the notebook is now capable of running Python, R and Scala in the same notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans: C\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5.Question 5\n",
    "\n",
